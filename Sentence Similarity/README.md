#### Technique 
Solved using pretrained [bert sentence similarity model "bert-base-nli-stsb-mean-tokens"]( https://github.com/UKPLab/sentence-transformers). 

Using pretrained bert first find sentences simialrty to input sentence.  Then using Cosine similarity pick those sentences whose sentence similarity is greater then some threshold.
